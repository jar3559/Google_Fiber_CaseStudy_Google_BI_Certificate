# Google_Fiber_CaseStudy_Google_BI_Certificate
This contains documents and final visualization for the completion of the Google Business Intelligence Certificate. 

The overarching goal of the project was to generate a dashboard that provides insight into repeat customer calls to the Google Fiber call center, 
including which markets had the most calls as well as what key issues were driving repeat calls. This information theoretically would
help Google Fiber better communicate with their customers and increase customer satisfaction.

Included in this are the the following documents: 
1) Stakeholder Requirments Document outlining key project needs and stakeholder requirments
2) Project Requirements Document identifying key success criteria and KPIs
3) Stategy Document indicating inital dashboard strategy
4) pdf of final dashboard generated to complete the project.
